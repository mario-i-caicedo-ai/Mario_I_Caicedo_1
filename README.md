I am a venezuelan/colombian [Theoretical Physicist](https://scholar.google.co.ve/citations?user=ybqui-EAAAAJ&hl=en) who, after 33 years in the academy at [Universidad Simón Bolívar](http://www.usb.ve/), am making a soft transition to
the fantastic world of Data Science.

As you can see, in the headings, this is my first GutHub web page, to create it I just closely followed the instructions given in [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA_c3bGQXlQ).

Needless to say, Physics is great fun, and so it is Data Science. Since the latter is so fashionable right now I will tell you that if you want to join the field, you will need to **seriously** study statistics, linear algebra and calculus. You will also will need lots and lots of coding in Python, R, SQL.

Well, I have just began, and did not think to much about content, while I do, I present you with a couple of images of Venezuela

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/mario-i-caicedo-ai/Mario_I_Caicedo_1/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
